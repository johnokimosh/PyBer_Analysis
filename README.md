# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis

 Management has requested additional analysis.

- Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-Sharing date by city type.
- Create a multiple-line graph to display total weekly fares by city type.
- Submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type, and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

- Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types

- Ridership and total drivers is lower in rural city types when compared to urban city types.

- Total Fare revenue is higher in urban city types compared to rural city types.

- Average Fare per ride and per driver is higher in Rural city types compared to urban city types.

- Total Fare by city type has high, mid and low points that correspond with Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types. This illustrates the disparity between the the city type categories in the previous section.

## Summary

- Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- Closing the gap between rural and urban city types may be achieved by discounting fares in rural city types to lower the per cost ride.
- Limiting the number to drivers in urban city types may increase the average cost per ride with potential to increase total fares.
- Driver incentive is already present in rural city type with a high per driver fare. Additional analysis should be completed to find driver barriers to enter the market.
